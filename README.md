* don't have duplicated key bindings, it's too confusing

* letter keys area are not changed
* control keys mostly are not changed too much relative to default layout
  * enter is at left thumb, much better
  * escape and shift is same key, it works great
  * backspace are still in top right corner, you want to use it will in symbol layer, so not in thumb positions
  * alt changed position relative to command, but this key isn't used much
* brackets, right side of num-shift keys, and the key left to 1 are combo
  * they are frequently used, and combo is easier to reach compared to 
  * except for underscore, it's a standalone key, that place is hard to reach anyway, so at same priority like a combo
* num keys are at symbols layer home row
  * all number related keys works in that layer as trans keys or combo
  * arrow keys also work in this layer, so you don't need to switch layer
  * left side of num-shift keys are at top row of symbols layer
* arrow keys are right side top of symbols layer
  * allows moving cursor in number mode
  * aligns with hjkl the Vim way
* control layer
  * control+arrow aligns with hjkl again.
* keyboard layer
